Don't stop believin',
hold on to that feelin'
Chasing dreams under the neon lights,
Dancing free in the starry nights.
Under starlit skies we roam,
Chasing dreams we call our own.

The stars are fading one by one,  
The night is over, dayâ€™s begun.  
But in my heart your light still glows,  
Like morning sun that softly shows.
